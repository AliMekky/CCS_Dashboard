Establishing and updating the monitoring plan\nThe monitoring plan referred to in Article 13(2) shall be established according to the risk assessment analysis carried out in Step 3 of Annex I, and updated with the purpose of meeting the monitoring requirements laid out in Article 13(1) according to the following criteria:\n1.1. Establishing the plan\nThe monitoring plan shall provide details of the monitoring to be deployed at the main stages of the project, including baseline, operational and post-closure monitoring. The following shall be specified for each phase:\n(a) parameters monitored;\n(b) monitoring technology employed and justification for technology choice;\n(c) monitoring locations and spatial sampling rationale;\n(d) frequency of application and temporal sampling rationale.\nThe parameters to be monitored are identified so as to fulfil the purposes of monitoring. However, the plan shall in any case include continuous or intermittent monitoring of the following items:\n(e) fugitive emissions of CO2 at the injection facility;\n(f) CO2 volumetric flow at injection wellheads;\n(g) CO2 pressure and temperature at injection wellheads (to determine mass flow);\n(h) chemical analysis of the injected material;\n(i) reservoir temperature and pressure (to determine CO2 phase behaviour and state).\n\nThe choice of monitoring technology shall be based on best practice available at the time of design. The following options shall be considered and used as appropriate:\n(j) technologies that can detect the presence, location and migration paths of CO2 in the subsurface and at surface;\n(k) technologies that provide information about pressure-volume behaviour and areal/vertical distribution of CO2-plume to refine numerical 3-D simulation to the 3-D-geological models of the storage formation established pursuant to Article 4 and Annex I;\n(l) technologies that can provide a wide areal spread in order to capture information on any previously undetected potential leakage pathways across the areal dimensions of the complete storage complex and beyond, in the event of significant irregularities or migration of CO2 out of the storage complex.\n\n1.2. Updating the plan\nThe data collected from the monitoring shall be collated and interpreted. The observed results shall be compared with the behaviour predicted in dynamic simulation of the 3-D-pressure-volume and saturation behaviour undertaken in the context of the security characterisation pursuant to Article 4 and Annex I Step 3.\nWhere there is a significant deviation between the observed and the predicted behaviour, the 3-D model shall be recalibrated to reflect the observed behaviour. The recalibration shall be based on the data observations from the monitoring plan, and where necessary to provide confidence in the recalibration assumptions, additional data shall be obtained.\nSteps 2 and 3 of Annex I shall be repeated using the recalibrated 3-D model(s) so as to generate new hazard scenarios and flux rates and to revise and update the risk assessment.\nWhere new CO2 sources, pathways and flux rates or observed significant deviations from previous assessments are identified as a result of history matching and model recalibration, the monitoring plan shall be updated accordingly.\n\n2. Post-closure monitoring\nPost-closure monitoring shall be based on the information collected and modelled during the implementation of the monitoring plan referred to in Article 13(2) and above in point 1.2 of this Annex. It shall serve in particular to provide information required for the determination of Article 18(1).\n\nEU CO2 Storage Directive\n\nThe directive on the geological storage of CO2 (so-called CCS Directive) establishes a legal framework for the environmentally safe geological storage of CO2 to contribute to the fight against climate change.

Paragraph 30\n\nProvisions are required concerning liability for damage to the local environment and the climate, resulting from any failure of permanent containment of CO2. Liability for environmental damage (damage to protected species and natural habitats, water and land) is regulated by Directive 2004/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage, which should be applied to the operation of storage sites pursuant to this Directive. Liability for climate damage as a result of leakages is covered by the inclusion of storage sites in Directive 2003/87/EC, which requires surrender of emissions trading allowances for any leaked emissions. In addition, this Directive should establish the obligation on the operator of the storage site to take corrective measures in case of leakages or significant irregularities on the basis of a corrective measures plan submitted to and approved by the competent national authority. Where the operator fails to take the necessary corrective measures, these measures should be taken by the competent authority, which should recover the costs from the operator.\n\nParagraph 34\n\nLiabilities other than those covered by this Directive, Directive 2003/87/EC and Directive 2004/35/EC, in particular concerning the injection phase, the closure of the storage site and the period after transfer of legal obligations to the competent authority, should be dealt with at national level.\n\nArticle 17: Closure and post-closure obligations\n\n1. A storage site shall be closed:\n   (a) if the relevant conditions stated in the permit have been met;\n   (b) at the substantiated request of the operator, after authorisation of the competent authority; or\n   (c) if the competent authority so decides after the withdrawal of a storage permit pursuant to Article 11(3).\n\n2. After a storage site has been closed pursuant to points (a) or (b) of paragraph 1, the operator remains responsible for monitoring, reporting and corrective measures, pursuant to the requirements laid down in this Directive, and for all obligations relating to the surrender of allowances in case of leakages pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC and preventive and remedial actions pursuant to Articles 5 to 8 of Directive 2004/35/EC until the responsibility for the storage site is transferred to the competent authority pursuant to Article 18(1) to (5) of this Directive. The operator shall also be responsible for sealing the storage site and removing the injection facilities.\n\n3. The obligations referred to in paragraph 2 shall be fulfilled on the basis of a post-closure plan designed by the operator based on best practice and in accordance with the requirements laid down in Annex II. A provisional post-closure plan shall be submitted to and approved by the competent authority pursuant to Article 7(8) and Article 9(7). Prior to the closure of a storage site pursuant to points (a) or (b) of paragraph 1 of this Article, the provisional post-closure plan shall be:\n   (a) updated as necessary, taking account of risk analysis, best practice and technological improvements;\n   (b) submitted to the competent authority for its approval; and\n   (c) approved by the competent authority as the definitive post closure plan.\n\n4. After a storage site has been closed pursuant to paragraph 1(c), the competent authority shall be responsible for monitoring and corrective measures pursuant to the requirements laid down in this Directive and for all obligations relating to the surrender of allowances in case of leakages pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC and preventive and remedial action pursuant to Articles 5(1) and 6(1) of Directive 2004/35/EC. The post-closure requirements pursuant to this Directive shall be fulfilled by the competent authority on the basis of the provisional post-closure plan referred to in paragraph 3 of this Article, which shall be updated as necessary.\n\n5. The competent authority shall recover from the operator the costs incurred in relation to the measures referred to in paragraph 4, including by drawing on the financial security pursuant to Article 19.\n\nEU CO2 Storage Directive\n\nThe directive on the geological storage of CO2 (so-called CCS Directive) establishes a legal framework for the environmentally safe geological storage of CO2 to contribute to the fight against climate change. It covers all CO2 storage in geological formations in the EU and the entire lifetime of storage sites. It also contains provisions on the capture and transport components of CCS, though these activities are covered mainly by existing EU environmental legislation, such as the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Directive or the Industrial Emissions Directive, in conjunction with amendments introduced by the CCS Directive.",

The board must adopt rules for public notice, hearings, and administrative procedures related to certification.\n3. The certificate cannot be issued until at least 15 years after CO2 injections end.\n\n**Certification Requirements**\nA certificate may be issued only if the geologic storage operator:\n- Complies fully with all regulations governing the storage site.\n- Demonstrates that the reservoir will permanently retain stored CO2.\n- Confirms that all wells, equipment, and facilities used in the post-closure period are in good condition and maintain mechanical integrity.\n- Has plugged wells, removed equipment and facilities, and completed all required reclamation work.\n- Shows that the stored CO2 has reached stability, meaning it is stationary, chemically combined, or unlikely to migrate beyond the reservoir boundary.\n- Provides financial security for at least 15 years following the issuance of the certificate of completion and continues to accept liability for the storage site.\n\n**Monitoring and Liability Transfer**\n1.

The obligations of the storage operator (for example, in relation to monitoring, reporting and corrective measures) whilst storage activities are taking place;\n   3. The operator\u2019s continuing obligations for a period after the closure of the storage site; and\n   4. The inspection of carbon dioxide storage complexes.\n\nThe purpose of the Directive is to establish a legal framework for the environmentally safe geological storage of carbon dioxide. Such a framework had been established in the UK by Part 1, Chapter 3, of the Energy Act 2008, which extends to Northern Ireland. The Act provided for a licensing regime governing the permanent storage of carbon dioxide offshore, including the UK territorial waters adjacent to Northern Ireland.",

You must develop and submit to the Administrator a proposed MRV plan for monitoring, reporting, and verification of geologic sequestration at your facility. Your proposed MRV plan must contain the following components:\n(1) Delineation of the maximum monitoring area and the active monitoring areas. The first period for your active monitoring area will begin from the date determined in your MRV plan through the date at which the plan calls for the first expansion of the monitoring area. The length of each monitoring period can be any time interval chosen by you that is greater than 1 year.\n(2) Identification of potential surface leakage pathways for CO2 in the maximum monitoring area and the likelihood, magnitude, and timing of surface leakage of CO2 through these pathways.\n(3) A strategy for detecting and quantifying any surface leakage of CO2.\n(4) A strategy for establishing the expected baselines for monitoring CO2 surface leakage.\n(5) A summary of the considerations you intend to use to calculate site-specific variables for the mass balance equation. This includes, but is not limited to, considerations for calculating CO2 emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions of CO2 between the injection flow meter and injection well and/or the production flow meter and production well, and considerations for calculating CO2 in produced fluids.\n(6) If a well is permitted under the Underground Injection Control program, for each injection well, report the well identification number used for the Underground Injection Control permit and the Underground Injection Control permit class. If the well is not yet permitted, and you have applied for an Underground Injection Control permit, report the well identification numbers in the permit application. If an offshore well is not subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act, for each injection well, report any well identification number and any identification number used for the legal instrument authorizing geologic sequestration. If you are submitting your Underground Injection Control permit application as part of your proposed MRV plan, you must notify EPA when the permit has been approved. If you are an offshore facility not subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act, and are submitting your application for the legal instrument authorizing geologic sequestration as part of your proposed MRV plan, you must notify EPA when the legal instrument authorizing geologic sequestration has been approved.\n(7) Proposed date to begin collecting data for calculating total amount sequestered according to equation RR-11 or RR-12 of this subpart. This date must be after expected baselines as required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section are established and the leakage detection and quantification strategy as required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section is implemented in the initial AMA.\n\n(b) Timing. You must submit a proposed MRV plan to EPA according to the following schedule:\n(1) You must submit a proposed MRV plan to EPA by June 30, 2011 if you were issued a final Underground Injection Control permit authorizing the injection of CO2 into the subsurface on or before December 31, 2010. You will be allowed to request one extension of up to an additional 180 days in which to submit your proposed MRV plan.\n(2) You must submit a proposed MRV plan to EPA within 180 days of receiving a final Underground Injection Control permit authorizing the injection of CO2 into the subsurface. If your facility is an offshore facility not subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act, you must submit a proposed MRV plan to EPA within 180 days of receiving authorization to begin geologic sequestration of CO2. You will be allowed to request one extension of the submittal date of up to an additional 180 days.\n(3) If you are injecting a CO2 stream in subsurface geologic formations to enhance the recovery of oil or natural gas and you are not permitted as Class VI under the Underground Injection Control program, you may opt to submit an MRV plan at any time.\n(4) If EPA determines that your proposed MRV plan is incomplete, you must submit an updated MRV plan within 45 days of EPA notification, unless otherwise specified by EPA.\n\n(c) Final MRV plan. The Administrator will issue a final MRV plan within a reasonable period of time. The Administrator's final MRV plan is subject to the provisions of part 78 of this chapter. Once the MRV plan is final and no longer subject to administrative appeal under part 78 of this chapter, you must implement the plan starting on the day after the day on which the plan becomes final and is no longer subject to such appeal.\n\n(d) MRV plan revisions. You must revise and submit the MRV plan within 180 days to the Administrator for approval if any of the following in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4) of this section applies. You must include the reason(s) for the revisions in your submittal.\n(1) A material change was made to monitoring and/or operational parameters that was not anticipated in the original MRV plan. Examples of material changes include but are not limited to: large changes in the volume of CO2 injected; the construction of new injection wells not identified in the MRV plan; failures of the monitoring system including monitoring system sensitivity, performance, location, or baseline; changes to surface land use that affects baseline or operational conditions; observed plume location that differs significantly from the predicted plume area used for developing the MRV plan; a change in the maximum monitoring area or active monitoring area; or a change in monitoring technology that would result in coverage or detection capability different from the MRV plan.\n(2) A change in the permit class of your Underground Injection Control permit.\n(3) If you are notified by EPA of substantive errors in your MRV plan or monitoring report.\n(4) You choose to revise your MRV plan for any other reason in any reporting year.\n\n(e) Revised MRV plan. The requirements of paragraph (c) of this section apply to any submission of a revised MRV plan. You must continue reporting under your currently approved plan while awaiting approval of a revised MRV plan.\n\n(f) Format. Each proposed MRV plan or revision and each annual report must be submitted electronically in a format specified by the Administrator.\n\n(g) Certificate of representation. You must submit a certificate of representation according to the provisions in \u00a7 98.4 at least 60 days before submission of your MRV plan, your research and development exemption request, your MRV plan submission extension request, or your initial annual report under this part, whichever is earlier.\n\nGreenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP)\n\nThe GHGRP requires reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) data and other relevant information from large GHG emission sources, fuel and industrial gas suppliers, and CO2 injection sites in the United States. Approximately 8,000 facilities are required to report their emissions annually, and the reported data are made available to the public in October of each year.",

                "text": "The final rule, at \u00a7 146.85(a)(1), identifies the following qualifying financial instruments for Class VI wells, all of which must be sufficient to address endangerment of USDWs. Standby trusts are not needed for options 1, 4, and 5.\n\n(1) Trust Funds: If using a trust fund, owners or operators are required to set aside funds with a third party trustee sufficient to cover estimated costs. During the financial responsibility demonstration, the owner or operator may be required to deposit the required amount of money into the trust prior to the start of injection or during the \u2018paying period\u2019 if authorized by the Director.\n\n(2) Surety Bond: Owners or operators may use a payment surety bond or a performance surety bond to guarantee that financial responsibility will be fulfilled. In case of operator default, a payment surety bond funds a standby trust fund in the amount equal to the face value of the bond and sufficient to cover estimated costs, and a performance surety bond guarantees performance of the specific activity or payment of an amount equivalent to the estimated costs into a standby trust fund.\n\n(3) Letter of Credit: A letter of credit is a credit document, issued by a financial institution, guaranteeing that a specific amount of money will be available to a designated party under certain conditions. In case of operator default, letters of credit fund standby trust funds in an amount sufficient to cover estimated costs.\n\n(4) Insurance: The owner or operator may obtain an insurance policy to cover the estimated costs of GS activities requiring financial responsibility. This insurance policy must be obtained from a third party to decrease the possibility of failure (i.e., non-captive insurer).\n\n(5) Self Insurance (i.e., Financial Test and Corporate Guarantee): Owners or operators may self insure through a financial test provided certain conditions are met. The owner or operator needs to pass a financial test to demonstrate profitability, with a margin sufficient to cover contingencies and unknown obligations, and stability. If the owner or operator meets corporate financial test criteria, this is an indication that the owner or operator can guarantee its ability to satisfy financial obligations based solely on the strength of the company\u2019s financial condition. An owner or operator who is not able to meet corporate financial test criteria may arrange a corporate guarantee by demonstrating that its corporate parent meets the financial test requirements on its behalf. The parent\u2019s demonstration that it meets the financial test requirement is insufficient if it has not also guaranteed to fulfil the obligations for the owner or operator.\n\n(6) Escrow Account: Owners or operators may deposit money to an escrow account to cover financial responsibility requirements. This account must segregate funds sufficient to cover estimated costs for GS financial responsibility from other accounts and uses.\n\n(7) Other instrument(s) satisfactory to the Director: In addition to these instruments, EPA anticipates that new instruments that may be tailored to meet GS needs may emerge, and may be determined appropriate for use by the Director for the purpose of financial responsibility demonstrations. The final rule specifies that the qualifying financial responsibility instrument must include protective conditions of coverage, including, but not limited to: Cancellation, renewal, and continuation provisions; specifications on when the provider becomes liable in case of cancellation if there is a failure to renew with a new qualifying financial instrument; and requirements for the provider to meet a minimum credit rating, minimum capitalization, and ability to pass the bond rating when applicable. This clarification was made in direct response to issues raised by commenters for numerous instruments, and also to make sure that there is no gap in coverage if a financial instrument fails.\n\nUnderground Injection Control Program\n\nThe Underground Injection Control program consists of six classes of injection wells. Each well class is based on the type and depth of the injection activity, and the potential for that injection activity to result in endangerment of an underground source of drinking water.\n\nClass I wells are used to inject hazardous and non-hazardous wastes into deep, isolated rock formations.\nClass II wells are used exclusively to inject fluids associated with oil and natural gas production.\nClass III wells are used to inject fluids to dissolve and extract minerals.\nClass IV wells are shallow wells used to inject hazardous or radioactive wastes into or above a geologic formation that contains a USDW.\nClass V wells are used to inject non-hazardous fluids underground. Most Class V wells are used to dispose of wastes into or above underground sources of drinking water.\nClass VI wells are wells used for injection of carbon dioxide (CO2) into underground subsurface rock formations for long-term storage, or geologic sequestration.\n\nUIC regulations mandate the consideration of a variety of measures to assure that injection activities will not endanger USDWs. The UIC program may be implemented by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or by states, territories, or tribes with EPA-approved primary permitting and enforcement authority. Activities performed by the UIC program include maintaining well inventory, permitting injection wells, performing inspections, and ensuring compliance with permit requirements. When operators manage wells in a way that does not meet the applicable UIC requirements, the program alerts operators to issues and may assist operators in returning the wells to compliance or take enforcement action.",

                "text": "**Site Closure Requirements for Class VI Wells**\n\nAfter injection ceases at a **Class VI Geologic Sequestration (GS) project**, the injection well must be **plugged** to ensure it does not become a conduit for fluid movement into **Underground Sources of Drinking Water (USDWs)** (**40 CFR 146.92**). The required well plugging activities include:\n- Flushing the well with a buffer fluid.\n- Testing the **external mechanical integrity** of the well.\n- Emplacing **cement** into the well in a manner that prevents fluid movement that could endanger USDWs (**40 CFR 146.92(a) and (b)**).\n- Using materials compatible with the injectate (**40 CFR 146.92(b)(5)**).\n\nThis guidance document provides details on **mechanical integrity testing, plugging procedures, material selection, and placement methods** (**40 CFR 146.92(b)(4)-(6)**) but does not impose new legal requirements. It also provides guidance on **notices of intent to plug and plugging reports**. Operators are encouraged to follow similar procedures for plugging monitoring wells.\n\n**Post-Injection Site Care (PISC) and Site Closure Plan**\n\n- The **PISC phase** requires **continued monitoring** as specified in the UIC Program Director-approved **PISC and Site Closure Plan** (**40 CFR 146.93(a); 40 CFR 146.82(a)(17)**).\n- This monitoring ensures that USDWs remain protected and generally mirrors operational-phase monitoring but may **decrease in frequency**.\n- Changes to monitoring during PISC require **approved amendments** to the PISC and Site Closure Plan (**40 CFR 146.93(a)(4)**).\n- The default **PISC period is 50 years**, unless an alternative timeframe is approved based on site-specific data, modeling, and other evidence (**40 CFR 146.93(c)**).\n- Operators may apply for **early site closure** if they demonstrate **non-endangerment** of USDWs before the 50-year mark (**40 CFR 146.93(b)(2)**).\n\n**Process for Obtaining Site Closure Approval**\n\nTo obtain approval for site closure, operators must submit **non-endangerment evidence** to the UIC Program Director, demonstrating that the project no longer poses a risk to USDWs (**40 CFR 146.93(b)(3)**). If approved, the operator must:\n1. **Submit a notice of intent to close** at least **120 days prior to site closure** (**40 CFR 146.93(d)**).\n2. **Submit a site closure report** within **90 days after site closure** (**40 CFR 146.93(f)**), including:\n   - Well plugging records.\n   - Notifications to authorities.\n   - Records regarding the injectate.\n\nThe EPA provides guidance on compiling this information and meeting **Class VI requirements**. Examples in the guidance are illustrative and do not create additional regulatory obligations.\n\n**Underground Injection Control (UIC) Program**\n\nThe UIC program consists of **six classes of injection wells** based on the type and depth of injection, and their potential to endanger **Underground Sources of Drinking Water (USDWs)**:\n- **Class I** \u2013 Hazardous and non-hazardous waste injection into deep, isolated rock formations.\n- **Class II** \u2013 Injection related to oil and gas production.\n- **Class III** \u2013 Injection for mineral extraction.\n- **Class IV** \u2013 Injection of hazardous or radioactive waste into or above a USDW.\n- **Class V** \u2013 Non-hazardous fluid injection (e.g., wastewater disposal above USDWs).\n- **Class VI** \u2013 Injection of **carbon dioxide (CO2) for long-term geologic storage**.\n\nUIC regulations ensure that injection activities **do not endanger USDWs**. The UIC program may be administered by **EPA, states, territories, or tribes** with **EPA-approved permitting authority**. Activities include well permitting, monitoring, compliance inspections, and enforcement actions.\n\n",
