Initiate Project (Screening - Identify)**\nTo ensure regulatory compliance at the early stages of a project:\n- Conduct a **geological feasibility study** that adheres to internationally recognized **CCS standards and directives**.\n- Prepare a **risk assessment report** to address potential environmental and operational risks.\n- Develop an **initial Monitoring, Measurement, and Verification (MMV) framework** to ensure CO₂ containment.\n- Engage with **regulatory authorities** early to understand permitting requirements and ensure alignment with **long-term site stewardship obligations**.\n- Ensure compliance with **environmental impact assessment laws** governing carbon storage.\n\n### **2. Select Prospective Sites (Appraisal - Assess)**\nBefore finalizing a site, ensure compliance with:\n- **Regulatory screening criteria** for site selection, such as those specified in **CCS Directives and national storage site approval laws**.\n- Geological assessments that confirm the site's ability to **permanently contain injected CO₂** without leakage risks.\n- Development of a **preliminary Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA)** that aligns with international and national environmental legislation.\n- Submission of a **site assessment report** that details geological, hydrogeological, and geomechanical properties.\n\n### **3. Select Storage Site (Permitting - Select)**\nBefore applying for a **storage permit**, ensure that:\n- The selected site meets the requirements for **geological storage capacity and containment security**.\n- A **CO₂ migration model** is developed to assess and mitigate risks of plume migration.\n- A **comprehensive storage plan** is submitted, including monitoring strategies, corrective measures, and financial assurances.\n- The operator demonstrates **technical and financial capacity** to manage the site through **long-term stewardship requirements**.\n\n### **4. Storage Permit Application (Design - Define)**\nRegulatory compliance in this phase includes:\n- **Submission of a complete permit application**, including the **total quantity of CO₂ to be injected**, monitoring plans, and risk mitigation strategies.\n- Ensuring that the **operator provides financial security guarantees** to cover site monitoring and post-closure obligations.\n- Establishing a **corrective measures framework** to address irregularities in CO₂ storage behavior.\n- Compliance with national and regional **liability regulations** concerning site operation and post-closure responsibilities.\n\n### **5. Initiate Construction (Construct - Execute)**\nBefore construction begins:\n- Ensure **regulatory approval** for injection wells and storage facilities.\n- Adhere to **well integrity and engineering standards** to prevent CO₂ leakage.\n- Implement **baseline monitoring measures** to detect any environmental changes pre-injection.\n- Secure **long-term financial assurances** to cover unexpected contingencies.\n\n### **6. Initiate CO₂ Injection (Operate - Operate)**\nDuring injection:\n- Maintain compliance with **CO₂ stream composition regulations**, ensuring injected gas meets purity and safety standards.\n- Continuously monitor **CO₂ plume migration**, well integrity, and reservoir pressure.\n- Submit **annual compliance reports** detailing injection volumes, pressure conditions, and environmental impact.\n- Ensure **corrective action procedures** are in place to address potential leakage incidents.\n\n### **7. Terminate Injection (Post-Inject - Close)**\nTo close an injection site:\n- Obtain a **Closure Permit** from the regulatory authority after demonstrating that **CO₂ storage remains secure**.\n- Continue **monitoring obligations** post-injection, ensuring site stability.\n- Submit a **final closure report** that includes storage verification data and risk assessments.\n- Prepare for **liability transition**, ensuring financial obligations are met for post-closure monitoring.\n\n### **8. Close Site (Post-Closure)**\nFinal regulatory requirements include:\n- Compliance with **post-closure monitoring obligations**, typically extending **30+ years post-injection**.\n- Ensuring **long-term liability management**, transitioning responsibilities to regulatory agencies once site stability is confirmed.\n- Payment into **Post-Closure Stewardship Funds**, covering long-term environmental and monitoring costs.\n- Demonstrating that stored CO₂ remains **permanently contained**, avoiding future regulatory violations.\n\n---\n\n## **Final Compliance Recommendations**\n- **Early Engagement**: Work with regulatory authorities early to ensure project approval.\n- **Strict Monitoring**: Adhere to **CO₂ monitoring, measurement, and verification** standards throughout the project lifecycle.\n- **Financial Security**: Ensure compliance with **financial assurance obligations** covering long-term site responsibilities.\n- **Risk Mitigation**: Implement **corrective measures** to prevent and manage CO₂ migration or leakage risks.\n- **Regulatory Documentation**: Maintain **detailed records and reports** for audits and compliance verification.\n\nThis guide ensures **compliance with the broadest set of CO₂ storage regulations** across **multiple jurisdictions**.
